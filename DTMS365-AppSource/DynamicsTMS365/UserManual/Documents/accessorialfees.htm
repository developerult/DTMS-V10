<h2>Accessorial Fees</h2>
<p class="MsoNormal">Pre-determined fees should be configured in the fee section 
of the carrier’s contract/tariff. These fees include stop fees, fuel, or any 
other fees that are required to calculate estimated carrier costs. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">If a carrier has a fee that is order specific such as 
Extended Length or Liftgate, you can set up this fee as a Profile Fee. This 
configuration will only calculate the fee value when a user selects this fee 
prior to rating a carrier on an order. When rating and prior to dispatching a 
shipment, users should select the accessorial if they want to include as part of 
the cost calculation i.e. Lift Gate or Extended Length. Profile fees set up are 
for tariff-based carriers and not API carriers. When a specific accessorial is 
selected the API carrier will return the fee automatically.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">To add a fee:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Click the add button and Add Fee screen will pop open.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><img src="../ImagesExt/image54_58.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Select from the drop-down list of pre-loaded fees. Additional 
fees can be configured, and you should contact support for more information.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Minimum</b> = Absolute minimum value i.e. $50. 
<br /><b>Maximum</b> = Absolute maximum value $0 (if applicable)<br /><b>Formula 
Variable</b> = such as .17 for 17% (if applicable and not a minimum)<br /><b>Calc 
Formula List</b> = Select the calculation formula according to the fee 
calculation type.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Each fee value can be carrier specific. So, one carrier may 
have a $50 min, and another can have a $40 min. When you assign a fee to a 
carrier, you then put in the fee value for that carrier.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Below you see a screenshot of fees configured for stops and 
fuel. The system knows how to apply stop fees based on the number of stops 
assigned. All stops should be configured to properly calculate stop fees. For 
example, you will need to add stop fee 4, 5 and 6 even if the fee cost is the 
same. To calculate fuel, users must add the fuel fee (per mile or 
percentage).<img src="../ImagesExt/image54_59.jpg" alt="" /></p><span id="related-topics"></span></body></html>
