<h2>Settlement Page</h2>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Settlement page allows carriers or TMS users to enter in 
freight invoices. We have two options and users should seek instructions on 
which option is best to use based on your implementation.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">1) <b>Quick Edit</b> – This is used for quick entry of the 
<i>Freight Invoice Number</i> and <i>Total Invoice Amount</i>. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><img src="../ImagesExt/image65_17.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Click on the <i>Quick Edit</i> button in the Actions menu. A 
dialog box will open.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><img src="../ImagesExt/image65_18.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">2) <b>Detailed Freight Bill Entry</b>-This is used to allow 
carriers/users to insert additional fees as part of their invoice. Click on the 
pencil icon to review and add fees.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><img src="../ImagesExt/image65_19.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The settlement page is where carriers will enter in their 
freight invoices and fees. Again, depending on credentials, not all carrier 
users will have access to this page. Carrier users, who have been set up as 
accounting users, will have access to the Settlement and Settled Page for 
carriers.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In order for carriers to see data and enter their freight 
invoice within the Settlement Page, they will be required to enter in a 
<b><i>delivery date/time stamp</i></b> in the ALL Page. Only loads with a 
delivery date will appear in the Settlement Page.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><i><span style="COLOR: red">Carriers must enter in their 
invoice for each load (CNS / ShipID). Summary invoices are not allowed. In 
situations where carriers have a summary invoice for more than 1 load, they must 
append a -1, -2 or –A, -B at the end of their invoice entry to make this freight 
invoice unique.</span></i></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><img src="../ImagesExt/image65_20.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Click on Settlement to enter in your freight invoices. Must 
have entered in Delivery Date/Time in All Page first.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><img src="../ImagesExt/image65_21.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">You can search for the CNS (aka ShipID) load you want to 
enter in your freight invoice for. Click on the pencil icon to EDIT.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>N Status</b> = Are new records waiting for freight bill 
entry.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>PENDING Status</b> = waiting on TMS user to approve 
entries.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>FAILED Status</b> = Are freight bills that have been 
entered but did not pass the audit function. This requires a TMS user to review 
this exception.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><img src="../ImagesExt/image65_22.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Click on the <i>Pencil icon</i> to enter <i>Detailed Freight 
Invoice</i> information. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i>The Detailed Freight Bill Entry</i> Screen will open. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Click on the <i>Information icon</i> for to review the 
pending/failed freight bill entry. Note you will not be able to edit the freight 
bill after it has been entered and saved. If you made a mistake, carrier should 
contact the shipper.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Depending on system configuration and requirements, it is 
important to receive instructions from the shipper on expectations and 
requirements for entering freight bills.  </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Carriers must enter in their Invoice Number for this 
shipment. Once the invoice number has been entered, carriers can now enter in 
fees associated with an invoice if necesssary. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Click and expand the black arrow next to the CNS Number 
(ShipID) and click <i>ADD FEE</i>. Some configurations will already display the 
fee as part of the original freight cost calculation. There is no need to enter 
this fee again. If the fee is incorrect, carriers can edit the value by placing 
your cursor in the cost field and enter in new value. If no more fees, click 
save and the system will run the audit function.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><img src="../ImagesExt/image65_23.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i>Too Add a fee:</i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Click <i>Add Fee</i> Select your appropriate fee that has 
been pre-configured from the drop-down list and fee amount. Click <i>Add Fee</i> 
again to add additional fees. If you do not see a fee that you’re trying to 
enter, contact the shipper prior to entering this invoice to have it added. At 
this time, you can close the page and re-enter invoice upon notice the fee has 
been updated. Do not click save until you have completed all entries.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">When entering fees for the same stop, you only need to enter 
the fee one time on one of the stops. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><img src="../ImagesExt/image65_24.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Click SAVE icon when done entering in fees. It is important 
to note that once fees have been entered and saved, the invoice process is 
complete, and carriers cannot change anything.</p>
