<h3>Carrier Scheduling Configuration</h3>
<p class="MsoNormal"><br />Next to Contacts is a tab called <i>Warehouse</i> 
<i>Carrier Settings</i>. This tab contains configuration settings for carriers 
who are assigned to this warehouse and <b>when the warehouse is not using 
the</b> <b>Automated Carrier Scheduling</b> functionality at this warehouse. 
This feature will also override the Legal Entity default when automation is on 
and use carrier specific settings. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><i><span style="COLOR: red">Note</span></i></b><i><span style="COLOR: red">, </span>when automated carrier scheduling is on at the Legal 
Entity, this means all locations and carriers are set to use automation. <b>If 
you want to turn off automation for a warehouse, each carrier needs to be added 
here and turn off all features OR turn off the Validation on each dock door for 
all non-automated warehouses.</b> Carriers will not be able to self-schedule 
appointments, but they will see the loads and can click a button and request an 
appointment. An email request will be sent to the scheduling administrator email 
indication carrier is requesting an appointment. As a reminder, this will need 
to be done for each non automated warehouse. </i></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">To assign carriers, click on ADD<i>.</i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><img border="0" src="../ImagesExt/image40_10.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Select carrier and turn off all features as indicated in 
yellow highlight below. Click Save when done. This must be done for all 
carriers.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Additionally, when carrier automation is on and if you want 
to <i>set carrier specific rules</i> <i>by location</i>, users can apply carrier 
specific rules here.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><img border="0" src="../ImagesExt/image40_12.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Click on the pencil icon to edit carrier settings. When

<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="COLOR: red">Note</span></b>: If you have 
multiple locations using the scheduling automation system, all settings are by 
warehouse location and must be configured separately.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Carrier Appt</b> = On/Off. When on, this carrier is 
allowed to self-schedule appointments in the scheduling system.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Allow Car Appt Edit</b> = On/Off. When on, allows carrier 
to edit their appointments using the automated scheduling system. When off, it 
requires a request to be made via the carrier through the scheduling system.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Allow Car Appt Delete</b> = On/Off. When on, allows the 
carrier to delete their appointment without any approval. When off, it requires 
a request to be made via the carrier through the scheduling system.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Appt Mod Cut Off Mins</b> = The time in minutes setting 
that a carrier must appoint an order before a request needs to be made by 
carrier. For example, 1440 minutes means carriers must appoint orders before a 
24-hr. window.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Default Last Load Time</b> = The time designator for the 
last appointment available to be made. Meaning, the system will prevent a 
carrier using automation for scheduling appointments beyond this time. Carrier 
will need to submit a request for an appointment.<span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: &quot;Calibri Light&quot;,sans-serif; COLOR: #1f4d78"></span></p><span id="related-topics"></span></body></html>
