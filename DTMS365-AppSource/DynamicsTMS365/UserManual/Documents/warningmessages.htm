<h4>Warning Messages</h4>
<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">These are warning attributes to warn the user on how to 
proceed with the order before importing.  Some silent or auto tendered 
orders will get stopped in the order preview screen.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 54pt; TEXT-INDENT: -18pt; tab-stops: 54.0pt">1.  
<b><i>CONFIRMED</i></b>: this order is a ship confirmed update.  Updates 
are followed by cost recalculations if costs are not locked.  BFC values 
and Total Costs are always reallocated by weight to the item level detail every 
time an update is received, even if the costs are locked, this is to account for 
the condition where items may have changed but the total cost remains the 
same.  An additional feature of the update process is the ability to update 
the pick list status upon ship confirmed.  This is controlled by the global 
parameter “<b>ImportAddConfirmedToPicklist</b>”.  </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 54pt; TEXT-INDENT: -18pt; tab-stops: 54.0pt">2.  
<b><i>NO PRO</i></b>: this is a new order being imported for the first time. 
Process as normal.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 54pt; TEXT-INDENT: -18pt; tab-stops: 54.0pt">3.  
<b><i>DELETE-B</i></b>:  The order has been transmitted with the delete 
code.  It has not been accepted by the carrier, not finalized.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 54pt; TEXT-INDENT: -18pt; tab-stops: 54.0pt">4.  
<b><i>DELETE-F</i></b>:  the order has been transmitted with the delete 
code.  It has already been accepted by the carrier (finalized). The users 
should cancel the order with the carrier, go to booking and select Drop 
Load, then click on process order in order preview or delete the order from 
the order preview screen</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 54pt; TEXT-INDENT: -18pt; tab-stops: 54.0pt">5.  
<b><i>DELETED</i></b>:  a matching order cannot be located in the booking 
table; we assume it was previously deleted.  This typically happens when we 
receive a ship confirmed and the order cannot be found.  There is a 
parameter, <b>GlobalTreatShipConfirmedLikeNew</b>, which can control this 
behavior.  If the parameter is on (1) the order will be marked with the No 
Pro attribute.  If the order is transmitted with the delete status code and 
the order cannot be found in the book table, the DELETED attribute will be 
displayed.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 54pt; TEXT-INDENT: -18pt; tab-stops: 54.0pt">6.  
<b><i>FINALIZED</i></b>:  a modification to the order was transmitted but 
the order has already been accepted by the carrier (finalized). Users should 
manually unfinalize the order before clicking on Process order or delete it from 
the Order Preview Screen if you do not want to bring in order changes. However, 
this will impact the order metrics and costs.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 54pt; TEXT-INDENT: -18pt; tab-stops: 54.0pt">7.  
<b><i>NO LANE</i></b>:  this attribute is applied with an order is 
transmitted and a lane cannot be located. The user should import the lane, 
create a lane manually; then re-transmit the order from the ERP system.  It 
may be possible to import the record from the order preview screen without 
re-transmitting, but all data must be checked for errors and this is not the 
recommended approach.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>

<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 54pt; TEXT-INDENT: -18pt; tab-stops: 54.0pt">8.  
<b><i>NEW TRAN</i></b>:  any new or modified order that is transmitted will 
be marked with the NEW TRAN attribute if the order data does not match the Lane 
Trans Type (CPU, Delivered etc..) (aka Shipment Method) or is different than the 
lane. It cannot be imported. Care should be taken when processing this 
order to be sure the correct carrier is assigned; the default carrier may 
not be correct. There is a company level parameter, 
<b><i>PODownloadNewTranWarningFlag</i></b>, Flag to determine if records in the 
order preview screen are marked with New Tran if it does not match lane.  
Prevents silent tender. 0 = off 1 = on.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 54pt; TEXT-INDENT: -18pt; tab-stops: 54.0pt">9.  
<b><i>NEW TRAN-F</i></b>: this attribute is applied with a modification where 
The Trans type (CPU, Delivered etc..) has changed or is different than the lane 
after the order has been finalized.  Users can import the record from the 
order preview screen, but the carrier requirements may have changed, and the 
load should be retendered.  We suggest that you unfinalize the order before 
importing.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 54pt; TEXT-INDENT: -18pt; tab-stops: 54.0pt">10. <b><i>NEW 
COMP</i></b>:  this attribute is applied when the company/location has 
changed to a different warehouse. This takes precedence over NEW TRAN. Loads 
cannot be imported for NEW COMP automatically.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 54pt; TEXT-INDENT: -18pt; tab-stops: 54.0pt">11. <b><i>SPLIT 
NEW COMP</i></b>: - The ship from warehouse (company) has changed.  Users 
cannot import this data and it must manually be deleted from the order preview 
screen once manual updates are complete.  Users must manually make 
corrections to the existing spit loads including ship from locations and item 
level details.  In the case where orders were split due to capacity manual 
adjustment of changes to item level details is required.  One option is to 
delete all orders that have been split manually and re-transmit the data from 
the ERP system, but this is a last resort.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 54pt; TEXT-INDENT: -18pt; tab-stops: 54.0pt">12. <b><i>SPLIT 
NEW TRAN</i></b>: - The Trans method (CPU, Delivered etc..) has changed or is 
different than the lane. Users cannot import this data and it must manually be 
deleted from the order preview screen once manual updates are complete.  
Users must manually make corrections to the existing spit loads including ship 
from locations and item level details.  In the case where orders were split 
due to capacity manual adjustment of changes to item level details is 
required.  One option is to delete all orders that have been split manually 
and re-transmit the data from the ERP system, but this is a last resort.  
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 54pt; TEXT-INDENT: -18pt; tab-stops: 54.0pt">13. <b><i>SPLIT 
ORDER</i></b>: - Users cannot import this data and it must manually be deleted 
from the order preview screen once manual updates are complete.  Users must 
manually make corrections to the existing spit loads including ship from 
locations and item level details.  In the case where orders were split due

it will turn to RED. </p>
