<h2>Step 2 - Go to AP Freight Bill Audit Approval Page</h2>
<p class="MsoNormal"><br />Select a carrier to review all freight invoices by 
carrier for a date range (From and To (current date)) that are in various stages 
of the auditing process. You must select a carrier and invoice received date 
range. Its best to go back a few months (30, 60, 90 days) to current date to 
ensure you have all transactions accounted for.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">TMS Auditing Workflow:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i><u>Normal (N)</u></i> = Invoices ready to be audited for 
selected carrier and invoice date range. Note, when filtered by this status, 
this screen should be blank at all times indicating there are no 
more transactions for selected carrier and invoice received date range to 
audit. To audit these transactions, simply click on the <em><span style="FONT-FAMILY: &quot;Verdana&quot;,sans-serif">Run Audit </span></em>button in the 
Actions menu to audit the invoice(s). If the audit passes, invoices will remove 
from this status and can be reviewed in the Approved status filter. If the audit 
fails, it will go to M status and requires attention. It is this screen where 
you re-run the audit manually by clicking the Run Audit Button in the Actions 
menu. This filter will also show M status transactions to be re-audited. 
<i><u></u></i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i><u>Matched (M)</u></i> = Invoices that have matched a 
transaction in TMS and have failed audit for selected carrier and invoice date 
range selected. Note, when filtered by this status, this screen should be blank 
at all times indicating there are no more matched/failed audit transactions for 
selected carrier and invoice received date range. All transactions in this 
status will need to be corrected before audit, approval, and sent to the ERP for 
payment. Users will need to make necessary invoice adjustments and then re-run 
the audit process while in the Normal filter and clicking <em><span style="FONT-FAMILY: &quot;Verdana&quot;,sans-serif">Run Audit </span></em>in the Actions 
menu. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i><u>Approved (AA)</u></i> = Invoices that have been 
approved and passed audit.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i><u>Electronic</u></i><u> </u>= Invoices that have come in 
via EDI only. Select this to view EDI invoices and in PA or M status.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i><u>Pending Approval (PA)</u></i> = Invoices that have fees 
waiting to be approved from the fee approval page. The audit process will not 
run until pending fees have been approved.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="COLOR: red">NOTE: When Normal (N) and Matched 
(M) are empty, this means there are no outstanding invoices to be audited for 
the selected carrier and time period. Users should check PA status on a regular 
basis for each carrier or go to the Pending Fee Approval Page.</span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Select carrier and apply invoice received date range. It’s 
best to review a 30-60-day date range.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Select your workflow = <b><i>Normal</i></b>. This will 
display all transaction statuses (N, M, PA).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Click and highlight any row.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><img src="../ImagesExt/image60_11.jpg" alt="" /> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In the Actions menu <b><i>Click Run Audit. </i></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><i>Note, the system will audit all transactions in this 
screen. </i></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><img src="../ImagesExt/image60_12.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">If audit was successful, all (N, M, or PA) transactions will 
go to (AA) Auto Approved status and be removed from this filter of <i>Normal 
</i>and now can be viewed in Approved filter. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Users can expand the black arrow to view messages as to the 
reason why a transaction cannot be audited. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">This example below is showing a message that this transaction 
is <i>pending approval</i> (PA) and cannot run through the audit. User must go 
to Fee Approval page and approve fee(s).</p>
