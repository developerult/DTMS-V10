<h3>Order Preview</h3>
<p class="MsoNormal"><br />The Order Preview page is an exception screen that will 
capture all order exceptions for each warehouse location. In most 
implementations, this will include an order modification i.e. customer added 
more product to the order or date changes. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i>Any order that already exists in TMS and is not booked 
(finalized) with a carrier the system will automatically bring in the changes 
into TMS.</i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">If the order has already been accepted and booked with a 
carrier (PB-Finalized) status, the order modification would come to this screen 
with a Warning Message <i>FINALIZED</i>. This is a warning to the user that this 
order already exists in the TMS and is booked with a carrier. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Another scenario would be if an order was shipping from one 
origin location and now customer service modifies an order to ship from a 
different location. The warning message would read <i>NEW COMP</i>. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">NO PRO means a new order; however, most implementations are 
configured to bring in new orders automatically.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Users should unfinalize (by going to the Booking Options tab 
in Load Board) the order (PB to P) that already exists in TMS and then bring in 
the order modification by clicking on the black arrow. The system will 
recalculate the costs for the carrier assigned and users should re-dispatch the 
load to the carrier as necessary, so the carrier has the updated information. If 
using an API carrier, users should re-rate the shipment and dispatch 
again.  </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Users can apply filters by Company (location) or Trans Type 
(FOB Delivered or CPU’s)</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><img src="../ImagesExt/image67_60.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Users can click on <i>View Import Changes </i>in the Actions 
section to identify the specific changes to the highlighted order.</p>
