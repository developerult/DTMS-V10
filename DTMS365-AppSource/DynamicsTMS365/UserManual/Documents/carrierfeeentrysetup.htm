<h2>Carrier Fee Entry Setup</h2>
<p class="MsoNormal"><br />Once you have completed the carrier set up, you will now 
want to complete the carrier fees set up to enable carriers to enter their 
fee(s) and invoices depending on your TMS configuration. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In the Carrier Page click on the <i>Actions Tab.</i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Click on<i> Carrier Name</i> so it turns blue.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Click <i>Add Accessorials</i>.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><img src="../ImagesExt/image39_19.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">This is where you will set up all fees unique to this carrier 
and fees you expect them to enter into the system when entering invoices or for 
EDI transactions. Each configuration can contain a variety of fee(s). Most 
common will be fees such as:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">          • 
Unloading    • Detention (Origin)  • Detention 
(Destination)</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">          • Tarp 
fee     • Re-delivery  • Stop 
charges         
          • Fuel</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-INDENT: 36pt">• Misc (this is a for any fee that 
may not be configured but allows entry by carrier)</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>For each fee you enter, you must select the workflow 
configuration you desire by checking the boxes and click save when done.</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><img src="../ImagesExt/image39_20.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i><span style="COLOR: red">Auto Approve</span></i><span style="COLOR: red"> </span>= If fee is within tolerance, it will bypass 
manual/tms user approval if checked on. If not checked, users will have to 
approve this fee each time to pass audit.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i><span style="COLOR: red">Allow Carrier 
Updates</span></i><span style="COLOR: red"> </span>= Allows carriers to enter 
this fee when entering an invoice if checked on. If not checked, carriers will 
not be able to enter fee.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i><span style="COLOR: red">Show Contracted 
Fees</span></i><span style="COLOR: red"> </span>= Precalculated fees as part of 
the carrier’s expected cost and <b>will display</b> in the Carrier invoice entry 
screen when checked on. <span style="COLOR: red">Recommended to leave 
checked</span>. If not checked, carriers will not see fee and will not be able 
to change/update fee. <b>Note, Carriers will not be able to edit fees. </b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Select your fee from the drop-down list. These fees are 
assigned in the Carrier page for each carrier. It is important to configure and 
make available all fees to carriers you expect them to enter. If a fee does not 
appear here, the carrier will not see the fee to apply for their invoice. Web 
Settlement Carriers should contact Logistics to set up fee if a fee is missing 
prior to entering invoices. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><img src="../ImagesExt/image39_21.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Once your fee is selected from the drop-down list, the 
Caption field and EDI Code (if set up) will auto populate. Users can insert 
caption text description if missing for the accessorial your configuring. Users 
should not modify EDI Code field unless they feel and have confirmed it is 
incorrect per carrier EDI Set up.</p><span id="related-topics"></span></body></html>
