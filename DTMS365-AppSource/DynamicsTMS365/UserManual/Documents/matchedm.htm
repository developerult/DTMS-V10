<h3>Matched (M)</h3>
<p class="MsoNormal">To view all invoices that have matched a transaction in TMS 
and failed audit, select carrier and filter by Matched (M). All invoices that 
have failed audit and status of M will display here. Users must fix all M 
transactions and run the audit process manually so they can be approved and sent 
to the ERP for payment.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">It is suggested to run the AUD075 – Load Audit Exception 
Report. This report will show all invoices that are in M status and need to be 
fixed by carrier. This report will show the difference between the expected cost 
and the billed cost. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><img src="../ImagesExt/image60_14.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In most cases the failed audits will be related to a 
differential in the line haul cost, providing that you approved all fees. The 
Company level tolerance settings prevent higher than expected freight bills from 
passing audit. This setting can be found in the Desktop client, under each 
company called, <i>Tolerances</i>.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><img src="../ImagesExt/image60_16.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The values look at the % low and % high values and the $ 
dollar amount low and high values when auditing total cost of the invoices.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Above settings:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">100% lower than billed cost to 10% above billed cost. If this 
is true, this passes this audit check.<br />$500 less than billed cost to $100 
higher than billed cost. If this is true, this passes this audit check.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">If either of these conditions fail, the freight bill will not 
pass audit. Both of these checks need to pass. If percentage passes but the 
dollar amount does not, it remains in M status and fails audit. These settings 
allow for freight invoices to pass due to minimal differential in pricing 
calculations.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i>If you set the % High to 0 and the dollar amount high to 
$0. This means the freight bill total cost needs to match or be lower in order 
to pass audit.</i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In order to approve and fix failed audits (M status) as a 
result of a higher than expected cost, users must go to the desktop client and 
add an <b>Invoice Adjustment Fee. This assumes all fees have been 
approved</b>.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Go to the desktop client and click on Find.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Expand Load in the Find section.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Search by ShipID or Freight Bill Number. Click and highlight 
either one, place your cursor in the field and hit enter. User can also search 
by order number (Maybe warehouse shipment number depending on your ERP 
configuration.)</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><img src="../ImagesExt/image60_17.png" alt="" /></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Go to the Revenue tab.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><img src="../ImagesExt/image60_18.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">If the Lock All Costs box is checked, users must uncheck this 
box to insert <i>Invoice Adjustment Fee</i>.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><img src="../ImagesExt/image60_19.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In the Ribbon Bar, click on Icon with Plus Sign to open up 
the fees table.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><img src="../ImagesExt/image60_20.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Search for the fee <i>Invoice Adjustment</i>, insert the 
difference in the total freight bill cost in the Minimum field. Click Save. The 
system will recalculate the total cost. Re-check the Lock All Cost field.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><img src="../ImagesExt/image60_21.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The next step is to Run the Audit function.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Go to the <i>AP Freight Bill Audit Approval Page</i> in the 
Web Client.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Select the appropriate carrier, apply your filter to Normal 
(or <i>Electronic</i> for EDI carriers) and insert the date range of the invoice 
your auditing. Once applied, you should see the transaction in the table.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><img src="../ImagesExt/image60_22.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Click and highlight the transaction.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In the Actions menu, Click Run Audit.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><img src="../ImagesExt/image60_23.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The system will update the records and perform the audit 
routine for this transaction or any other transactions that maybe on this 
screen. If Approved, the record(s) should remove from this filter and can be 
found in the APPROVED section. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Apply your filter to see APPROVED invoices and you should see 
the invoice is now approved.</p><span id="related-topics"></span></body></html>
