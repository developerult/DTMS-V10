<p class="MsoNormal">The major change in v-8.2.x has been the addition of the 
Legal Entity configuration (see the “Dynamics TMS - Legal Entity 
Maintenance.docx” training document for more details).  Legal Entities 
provide multi-tenant capabilities and support for detailed security not 
available before.  For existing customers upgrading to v-8.2.x one Legal 
Entity will be created automatically as part of the upgrade process and existing 
users will be assigned to this new Legal Entity.  NEXTrack Carriers Users 
are always assigned to the Legal Entity of  “None” and will have access to 
all loads tendered to them from any Legal Entity.  </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In previous versions of Dynamics TMS User Maintenance and 
security was divided into two separate components.  The NEXTrack users and 
the Dynamics TMS users.  The security and maintenance of these two 
components has now been combined into one system.  </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The new system has added a new hierarchy for security which 
follows this design:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Super Users: composed of NGL Support Staff and one 
Administrator.  Super users may be assigned to a Legal Entity, but security 
restrictions are not applied.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Carriers:  Legal Entity “None”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Legal Entity Warehouse: NEXTrack Only users</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Legal Entity CSR Sales: NEXTrack Only users</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Legal Entity Administrators: Administration of all components 
for a specific Legal Entity</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Legal Entity Operations: General dispatching and traffic 
management for a specific Legal Entity</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Legal Entity Accounting: Financial data and freight bill 
processing.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">It is possible to create custom security roles, but it is 
recommended that you contact NGL support for assistance to ensure 
compatibility.</p><span id="related-topics"></span></body></html>
