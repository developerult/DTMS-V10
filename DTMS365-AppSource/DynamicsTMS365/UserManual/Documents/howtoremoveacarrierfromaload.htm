<h3>How to Remove a Carrier from a Load</h3>
<p class="MsoNormal">In some cases, you may need to update an order or simply 
remove a carrier from a load. The following options are available. This can be 
done by clicking and highlighting the load and going to the Booking Options 
button in the actions bar.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><img src="../ImagesExt/image67_56.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Reject</b> = Carrier rejected the load and when YES, sets 
the Trans Code Status to <b>N</b>. Also used to remove assigned carrier from a 
load. If load was in PB status, this will send an email notification to carrier 
indicating this load was rejected/cancelled. Always best to communicate with 
carriers on any cancellations. If using API’s, it is recommended to contact 
carrier directly to cancel pick up request or follow your normal procedure for 
communicating with carrier. A “Load Rejection” email notification will be sent 
to Tariff and API carriers and should be considered cancelled. Must have carrier 
email set up in the email field in the carrier contact page.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Modify</b> = User is modifying order and when YES, sets 
the Trans Code Status to <b>P</b>. An email notification will be sent to carrier 
indicating a modification is taken place. User should re-tender the load to 
carrier when done. User should confirm acceptance process with carrier based on 
your SOP.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Accept</b> = User accepts load on behalf of carrier 
manually and when YES, sets the Trans Code Status to <b>PB</b>. When carriers 
accept load via the portal, the system will automatically move the Trans Code 
Status to <b>PB</b>, meaning carrier accepted the load.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Click <b><i>SAVE</i> </b>when done.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="COLOR: red"></span></b> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="COLOR: red">Note: ALL LOADS WILL NEED TO BE 
IN PB STATUS WHEN COMPLETE. Be sure to review all statuses as part of your 
process to ensure all loads are booked as required and nothing is left 
behind.</span></b><span style="COLOR: red"></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><img src="../ImagesExt/image67_57.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i>N</i> = New Load (no carrier assigned)<br /><i>P</i> = 
Carrier assigned but not booked.<br /><i>PC</i> = Load has been tendered to 
carrier.<br /><i>PB</i> = Carrier Accepted the load (Finalized).<br />IC – Invoice 
Complete and has passed audit.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Load Dispatch Report will print to screen. Click the 
print icon to print confirmation if required.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><img src="../ImagesExt/image67_58.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The BOL will also print to screen following the Load Dispatch 
Report. If you decide to print later, highlight the order and select Print BOL 
in the Actions Menu. </p>
