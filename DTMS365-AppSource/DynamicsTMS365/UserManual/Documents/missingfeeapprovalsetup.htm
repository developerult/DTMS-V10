<h2>Missing Fee Approval Set Up</h2>
<p class="MsoNormal">When a fee comes into TMS for the first time and it is not 
configured as part of the carrier’s fee tolerance settings, users can configure 
the fee for automation so the next time this fee comes in, it will follow the 
business rules for automation and approval.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><img title="A screenshot of a computer&#xA;&#xA;Description automatically generated" alt="A screenshot of a computer&#xA;&#xA;Description automatically generated" src="../ImagesExt/image61_16.jpg" /></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><u>Auto Approve</u> = Check the box to have this fee auto 
approve based on tolerance settings. Otherwise, users will need to approve this 
fee next time.<br /><u>Allow Carrier Updates</u> = Check the box to allow carrier 
updates (via Portal or EDI) <b><span style="COLOR: red">Recommended.</span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><u>Show Contracted Fees</u> = Check the box to display fees 
during invoice entry (via Portal). <b><span style="COLOR: red">Recommended.</span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Then select your tolerance settings-Select only one.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="COLOR: #4472c4">BLUE</span> -Insert dollar value 
low and high. For example, $25 (low) between $100 (high). You accept anything 
between $25 - $100 for this fee.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="COLOR: red">RED</span> – Check <i>Dynamic 
Expected Cost</i> to insert a percentage low and high range. For example, 100% 
(% below) to 25% (% above)</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Or</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Set your <i>Expected Cost</i> at $50. Your percentage low set 
to 20% (which is $50-$10=$40) to 20% above ($50 + $10 = $60) above. This fee 
expected price range is between $40 - $60. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Go to the <i>Fee Approval</i> <i>Screen </i>and approve any 
waiting fees entered by a user or carrier. You will need rights to access this 
page. Click on Edit to change the amount you want to approve or click 
Approve.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">You can filter the data to see fees by carrier etc. 
Additional filters can be applied. You will see every fee entered by a TMS user, 
carrier, or EDI for a given load that needs approval in this screen. It might be 
helpful to group the data by ShipID (CNS Number) to see fees associated to the 
same ShipID (invoice).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><img src="../ImagesExt/image61_18.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><u>For example:</u></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Filter by: CNS106722</b><br />Any of the column headers such 
as CNS Number by clicking and dragging the header just above its location. If 
you click on the group label, it will sort ascending / descending if you hit it 
a second time. The third time will remove the sort.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><img src="../ImagesExt/image61_19.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><img src="../ImagesExt/image61_20.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Users should review each fee by carrier and either 
<b><i>Approve</i> </b>or <b><i>Edit</i> </b>the fee.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><img src="../ImagesExt/image61_21.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><img src="../ImagesExt/image61_22.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><i>Approve</i></b> = when users click on <i>Approve, 
</i>you are agreeing to the amount entered by the carrier. This will update the 
fee(s) amount in the Revenue Screen and re-calculate and update the carrier 
cost. Then push this invoice through the audit function.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><i>Edit</i></b> = User is modifying the carrier fee entry 
and is approving the lessor or higher amount entered by the carrier. This will 
update the fee(s) amount in the Revenue Screen and re-calculate the carrier 
cost. Then push this invoice through the audit function. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><img src="../ImagesExt/image61_23.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Click Save when done.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The system will display what the carrier entered as a fee 
value versus what the tendered cost for this predetermined fee.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><img src="../ImagesExt/image61_24.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Locked Costs Approval</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">If the cost box is locked, the system will prompt the user a 
warning messaging indicating that this is a fee associated with a Locked Cost 
load (Spot or API carrier) and have been locked to protect from automated 
updates. All Spot Rate/API loads are “locked” in TMS to prevent automated 
updates. Users can also see which loads have locked costs by the display box. If 
checked, Costs are locked.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><img src="../ImagesExt/image61_25.png" alt="" /></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Before any fees can be approved, the system will notify the 
user that costs are locked and must click <b>OK</b> in order for the system to 
unlock the carrier costs automatically, allowing the system to insert the fee 
update to the Revenue Screen in TMS and recalculate costs. <br /><br /><img src="../ImagesExt/image61_26.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">After invoice has been entered. The system will update the 
status of the invoice based on the system configuration.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><u>There are 3 status workflows:</u></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><i>1) AA = Approved</i></b><i>. </i>The system 
automatically approved the entry, passed audit, and will disappear from the 
screen. Setting the PExp (Pay Expense workflow to AA-auto approved) in the Load 
Detail Screen.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">There are three ways to view <b>AA</b> statuses:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">A) Go to Load Board (Web Client) and apply the filter called 
Pay Code = AA for a record.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><img src="../ImagesExt/image61_27.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">B) Go to the Load Detail Screen (Desktop Client) for this 
load. The PExp will be in AA status.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">C) Go to AP Freight Bill Audit Approval Screen (Web Client) 
and apply the filter called Pay Code = AA</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><img src="../ImagesExt/image61_28.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">          a. 
Apply your filter by carrier.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">          b. 
Select a date range based on invoice date. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">          c. Use 
drop down and select <i>Approved</i> to see all approve freight invoices for 
this date range.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><i>2) PA = Pending Approval. </i></b>The system accepted 
carrier web/EDI entry and is waiting on TMS user approval. This transaction will 
remain in the Pending Approval Page until a user approves them.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><img src="../ImagesExt/image61_29.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">There are three ways to view <b>PA</b> statuses:</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><img src="../ImagesExt/image61_30.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The status will be updated in TMS on all loads that are 
<i>Pending Approval</i> (PA). Setting the PExp (Pay Expense workflow to 
PA-Pending Approval) in the Load Detail Screen.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">B) Go to the Load Detail Screen (Desktop Client) for this 
load. The PExp will be in PA status.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b><i>3) M = Match/Failed. </i></b> The system accepted 
the freight invoice entry as a matched transaction in TMS but has failed the 
audit process. All transactions will need to be fixed, re-audited, and pass 
audit to be set to AA status.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">There are three ways to view <b>M</b> status 
transactions:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">A) Go to Load Board (Web Client) and apply the filter called
