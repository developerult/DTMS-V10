<h2>Lane Maintenance</h2>
<p class="MsoNormal"><br />This page contains all your lanes (origin / destination 
pairs) for every combination for this legal entity. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Click on the pencil icon to edit or review more detailed 
information regarding this lane. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i>Delivery notes</i> are default comments that are typically 
static for every shipment, for example Call for delivery appointment 24hrs. in 
advance. Users can add notes that will be sent to carriers upon tender. Delivery 
Notes will appear on the TMS BOL.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i>Confidential comments</i> are for internal eyes only and 
will not be shared outside of TMS or with any carrier.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><img src="../ImagesExt/image35_1.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Depending on your TMS configuration the only recommended 
changes that should be made are the contacts, dock hours, phone, and email 
address. Please contact your support team before you change any other fields. 
Name and Number should never be changed.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">If a lane is an Inbound lane (Vendor to your location) the 
box should be checked to indicate this is an Inbound lane. This should happen 
automatically unless a manual lane was created.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">When using LTL carrier API’s some default information is 
required to be populated upon dispatching for both the origin location and 
destination location such as contact, phone, and email address. Be sure this 
information is maintained accordingly. Users will have a chance to enter this 
information prior to dispatching. When entered on the lane, the system will use 
this information as default for each order. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The system by default will look to the order for this 
information. If Origin information is missing the system will look for this 
information in the lane origin. If missing, the system will use the defaulted 
contact for company location contact name, email, and phone. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">If defaulted Destination contact information is missing, 
users will need to populate at time of dispatching.</p>
