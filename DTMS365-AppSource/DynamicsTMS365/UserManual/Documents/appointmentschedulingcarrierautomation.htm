<h1>Appointment Scheduling- Carrier Automation</h1>
<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Carriers will only have access to this page if the 
self-appointed automated scheduling system has been configured. Carriers will 
have access to appoint both pickup and delivery appointments for loads that have 
been assigned to them. Using your normal login credentials, carriers can click 
on <i>Carrier or Carrier Grouped </i>under Appointment Scheduling to see all 
orders/loads ready to appoint. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Carrier – Will display a single order associated with a 
ShipID (CNS Number)</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><img src="../ImagesExt/image65_31.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i>Carrier Grouped </i>-expand the black arrow to display all 
orders linked to the same ShipID. An example would be a multi stop shipment with 
many orders that have the same ShipID.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">The pending orders summary chart will display orders that are 
ready to appoint within a 72-hour window (Time window based on user 
configuration). Carriers can appoint orders/loads as soon as the load is 
available under the <i>Unscheduled Orders – Pick Up </i>tab.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><img src="../ImagesExt/image65_34.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">To schedule an appointment, click on the Unscheduled Orders 
tab.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><img src="../ImagesExt/image65_35.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Here you will see a list of the orders/loads that have been 
assigned to you and waiting to be appointed.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><img src="../ImagesExt/image65_36.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Grouping- Users can group the data by CNS or ShipID by 
clicking on the label and dragging the column up and releasing in the block. 
This will group all orders assigned to the same CNS or ShipID for easier 
viewing. In other words, the same load.</p>

same appointment. For example, could be a trailer number, carrier number etc.

appointment applied.</p>

request is within a certain time frame prior to loading based on shipper’s 
configuration.</p><span id="related-topics"></span></body></html>
