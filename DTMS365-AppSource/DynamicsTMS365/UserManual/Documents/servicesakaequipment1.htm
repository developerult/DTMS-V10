<p class="MsoNormal">After creating your contract, you will need to configure the 
Service associated with this contract.  Service is also synonymous with 
equipment. For example: <i>1) Van 2) Reefer 3) Standard LTL 4) Truckload 5) 
Intermodal 6) Hopper 30 7) Priority LTL 8) Flatbed</i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Each contract is associated with the respective 
service/equipment. For example, Carrier <i>Lee Trucking</i> can have an LTL 
contract and a TL contract. Or Lee Trucking can have a <i>Reefer</i> Contract 
and a <i>Flatbed</i> contract.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">When configuring the capacities, usually only the maximums 
are required. For simplicity, you can just populate the Weight Max to be 42,000 
lbs. or the max value of your loads/equipment. Service/Equipment is a default 
configuration setting.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">If you set the weight max to 20,000 lbs., this means that 
this tariff will not be available for any order over 20,000 lbs. the system 
assumes you do not have equipment to move that load. All conditions must match 
the capacity settings. Or if you set your truckload capacity with a minimum of 
20,000 and maximum of 42,500 lbs. This tariff will not appear on smaller 
shipments under 20,000 lbs.</p>
