<h3>Adding a Carrier User</h3>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="tab-stops: 348.45pt"> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="tab-stops: 348.45pt">In User Maintenance, adding 
carrier users will allow access to <i>Web tenders</i>, <i>Load postings</i>, 
<i>Online scheduling, Freight bill entry.</i> We have two types of carrier user 
set ups. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="tab-stops: 348.45pt">1) <i>Carriers</i> - This user 
profile is typically for a dispatcher (accepts loads, schedules appts, and 
provides load status.<br />2) <i>Carrier Accountants</i> – This user profile 
enters in freight bills into the website but also can be a dispatcher. This 
provide additional access to the Settlement/Settled screen for freight bill 
entry and review.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="tab-stops: 348.45pt"><b>NOTE</b>: If you have 
dispatchers who are responsible for entering in freight bill invoices, you can 
just set them up as a Carrier Accountants.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="tab-stops: 348.45pt">Enter in carriers email address. 
This email address will be used in case carrier resets password. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="tab-stops: 348.45pt">Insert a username such as carrier 
users email address to keep it simple. <a href="mailto:johnsmith@carrier.com">johnsmith@carrier.com</a> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="tab-stops: 348.45pt">You can pre-assigned passwords or 
have the system auto-generate one. It is recommended to manually create password 
for testing credential purposes. <i>It is recommended that users test the 
carrier credentials prior to handing over username and password to 
carrier.</i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="tab-stops: 348.45pt">If <i>Send Password to User</i> 
is checked, an email will be sent to the carrier’s email address and include 
their password. Confirm receipt with carrier. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="tab-stops: 348.45pt">Check the box for Accounting 
<b><u>ONLY</u></b> if this user will be entering in freight invoices into the 
Web Portal. This will give the user access to the Settlement and Settled pages. 
</p>

associated with using the drop-down list.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="tab-stops: 348.45pt">All Carrier users will be 
assigned to the Legal Entity called <b><i><u>NONE</u></i></b>. This means the 
carrier will be able to see all loads if there are multiple legal entities.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="tab-stops: 348.45pt">Go to Legal Entity and select 
None. You will see a list of all carrier users. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="tab-stops: 348.45pt">Now, add this user as a contact 
in the Carrier Page. Check the default box if this contact is to receive all 
load tenders. It’s best to use the carrier group distribution email alias to 
communicate with multiple contacts.</p>
