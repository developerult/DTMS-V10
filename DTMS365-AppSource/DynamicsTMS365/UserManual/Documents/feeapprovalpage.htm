<h1>Fee Approval Page</h1>
<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Fee Approval page (Under Load Planning) allows users to 
review fees entered by carriers or via EDI and require approval for auditing 
purposes. Fee tolerances can be assigned to each fee and if the fee falls within 
the tolerance, users can turn on auto approve or manually approve the fee. See 
Carrier Page for Fee Tolerances set up.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="COLOR: red">NOTE: If a fee has not been 
configured as part of the carrier set up (see Carrier Document Fee Tolerance Set 
Up), the fee value sent by carrier via EDI will not be approved and will need 
approval before the audit process can be completed. The fee will remain in the 
Fee Approval screen until approved by TMS user. </span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="COLOR: red">When such a fee comes to this 
page, users should update the carrier fee tolerance setup and configure the fee 
so the fee will follow the automation of business rules when applied for the 
next invoice.</span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="COLOR: red">Any Web Settlement carrier should 
contact the logistics department to notify them that a particular fee is not set 
up, therefore they should not enter in the freight bill until fee has been 
configured by TMS user.</span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="COLOR: red">It is important that users 
monitor this page and approve as required in order for these transactions to be 
audited by TMS. Once you have completed the approval process, users should 
review the AP Freight Bill Audit Screen or run the Auditing Report for any 
remaining failed audits. </span></b></p>
