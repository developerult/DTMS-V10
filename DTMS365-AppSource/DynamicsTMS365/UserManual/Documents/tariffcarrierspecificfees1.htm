<h1>Tariff/Carrier Specific Fees </h1>
<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Tariff/carrier specific fees are configured, maintained, and 
set up in each carrier tariff contract.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><img src="../ImagesExt/image36_10.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Tariff fees are assigned when a carrier is selected or when 
the <i>Recalculate Using Tariff</i> procedure is selected from the Ribbon bar. 
Tariff fees cannot be edited at the order level once they have been 
assigned.  Attempts to edit a Tariff specific fee will automatically create 
an Order specific fee that Overrides (replaces) the assigned Tariff specific 
fee.  Once an override has been created updates to tariff specific fees, 
including fuel surcharge updates, will not be applied to the order and possibly 
the entire load.  An order specific fee will always override (replace) any 
matching Tariff specific fee.   So, if we override a Tariff specific 
unloading charge this new Order specific fee will always be used to calculate 
the unloading charge unless the Order specific fee is removed.  </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">There are two ways to remove an order specific fee:  (1) 
Re-set the order or Load to “N” status this will remove all Order and Tariff 
specific fees; (2) Manually remove Order specific fees from each order by 
selecting the fee and clicking the delete key on the keyboard.  It is 
important to note that on consolidated loads if the allocation method is set to 
allocate across more than one order or stop the system may try to replace the 
fee after it is deleted.  If this happens you must use option (1) and reset 
to N status.</p>
