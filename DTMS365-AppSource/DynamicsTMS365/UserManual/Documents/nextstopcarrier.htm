<h1>NEXTStop Carrier</h1>
<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">This is the internal load posting or bidding solution. 
Carriers who are configured to gain access to shipper information may be granted 
access to the bid pages. Only carriers that have been granted access will be 
able to participate in reviewing and entering bids.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><img src="../ImagesExt/image65_26.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">To bid on a load, click on the BID icon and a screen will pop 
open and allow you to submit your bid. Please enter any comments about this 
load.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><img src="../ImagesExt/image65_27.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Once the bid is submitted, the TMS user will have knowledge 
that a bid has been submitted. TMS users will award the bids. If you have been 
awarded a bid, an email will be sent to the dispatcher email address set up by 
TMS user, requesting you to login and accept the load under the Tendered Page. A 
PDF attachment will also be included in the email</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Most users will enter in an all-inclusive rate. Carrier 
bidders can add a comment for the shipper to see. Carriers should refer to 
shipper on requirements for bid entry.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>IF NOT QUOTING FUEL, MUST ENTER ZERO COST AS A FLAT 
RATE.</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><img src="../ImagesExt/image65_28.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Click <b><i>Submit Bid</i></b> when done. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Bids placed will now be visible in the Pending Bids page. 
Carriers can withdraw their bid by clicking the <i>Withdraw</i> button.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><img src="../ImagesExt/image65_29.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Once a user has awarded the carrier a bid, an email will be 
sent to the dispatch office notifying them a load has been tendered to them. 
Carriers will find this tender in the <i>Tender Page</i> and they 
<b><u>must</u></b> accept or reject the tender.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Finalized Bids (bids carrier has accepted) will be visible in 
this section for reference. The status code displays if the TMS user accepted or 
rejected the bid.</p>
