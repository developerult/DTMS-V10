<h2>Fee Calculation Precedence</h2>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 36pt"><b>Fee Calculation type: </b>fees 
are calculated based on one of the following settings</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 54pt; TEXT-INDENT: -18pt; tab-stops: 54.0pt">1.  
<b>All</b> = combine all fees together (default)</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 54pt; TEXT-INDENT: -18pt; tab-stops: 54.0pt">2.  
<b>Unique</b> = only one fee will be included based on the accessorial 
type.  Duplicates will be ignored and marked as overwritten For example: if 
there is an unloading fee at lane level and unloading at order level, only the 
order level unloading fee will be applied There is an order of precedence<b> 
</b>used to resolve conflict with fee calculation types.  This precedence 
is order, Lane, Tariff. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 108pt; TEXT-INDENT: -18pt; tab-stops: 108.0pt">a.  Any 
fee marked as unique will only be overwritten if the exact fee exists at the 
order level or lane level.  If the user deletes the previous overwritten 
fee, it will be reset back to originals.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 108pt; TEXT-INDENT: -18pt; tab-stops: 108.0pt">b.  
Exception to the rule – NEXTrack self-service carrier fee submittal process may 
affect how these fees are calculated to be defined.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 54pt; TEXT-INDENT: -18pt; tab-stops: 54.0pt">3.  
<b><span style="BACKGROUND: yellow">Carrier over lane</span></b> = carrier fees 
have the ability to override lane fees and will combine with order specific 
fees. For example: if there is a carrier unloading charge and lane unloading 
charge and an order unloading charge; the carrier and order unloading charge 
will be added together and the lane charge will be ignored, and the lane fee 
will be marked as overwritten. Note: the order specific fee is not required for 
this calculation type</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 54pt; TEXT-INDENT: -18pt; tab-stops: 54.0pt">4.  
<b>Lane over Carrier = </b>lane fees have the ability to override carrier fees 
and will combine with order specific fees. For example: if there is a carrier 
unloading charge and lane unloading charge and an order unloading charge; the 
lane and order unloading charge will be added together and the carrier charge 
will be ignored, and the carrier fee will be marked as overwritten. Note: the 
order specific fee is not required for this calculation type</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 54pt; TEXT-INDENT: -18pt; tab-stops: 54.0pt">5.  
<b>Carrier over all = </b>carrier fee will always overwrite lane and order 
specific fees</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 54pt; TEXT-INDENT: -18pt; tab-stops: 54.0pt">6.  
<b>Lane over all = </b>lane fees will always overwrite carrier and orders 
specific fees</p>
