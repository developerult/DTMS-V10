<h1>Lane Fees</h1>
<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Lane Fees are maintained in the Lane Fees pane under Lane 
Maintenance.  These fees are location specific and are only assigned to an 
order once, when the order is first imported.  An example would be Canadian 
Tax calculation by Providence or locations specific unloading fee regardless of 
carrier. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Lane fees are not assigned to orders that are created 
manually; orders that are created using the “<i>Duplicate Pro Number</i>” 
procedure; or orders that are created using the “<i>Create a new Sequence</i>” 
procedure.  Lane Fees cannot be modified they can only be overridden 
(replaced) by an Order Specific Fee.  To override a Lane Fee open the 
order’s Revenue Tab, attempt to edit the Lane Fees minimum value, tab out of the 
minimum value field and expand the Order specific fee data grid.  The 
system will automatically generate a new Order specific fee that can be edited 
with the desired cost structure; the original Lane Fee will be displayed in Red 
and marked ads overridden.  If the Lane Fee has a cost allocation formula 
that will affect other orders these orders will also be assigned an Order 
specific fee override.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">When an order or a load is returned to N status, “The carrier 
is Unassigned”, all Tariff and Order specific fees will be removed, while the 
order is in N status the Lane Fee will still display Red and will be marked as 
overridden until a new carrier has been assigned.  During recalculation the 
system will determine if the original Lane Fee can be used or if a new Order 
specific fee is required.  Order specific fees are required if a conflict 
between multiple Lane Fees are found on the same load with similar configuration 
setting.  Like when there are two different unloading fees allocated across 
the same stop.  The system will create an Order specific fee during 
allocation that will reflect the highest cost.  Users may then modify the 
Order specific fee as needed.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">If all the Order specific fees associated with an overridden 
Lane Fee are removed the system will attempt to use the original Lane Fee where 
possible unless another conflict with allocation is detected.  Again the 
system will attempt to resolve the conflict by creating Order specific fees as 
needed.  Under some conditions the only way to resolve Lane Fee conflicts 
on consolidated loads is by the use of an Order specific fee.</p>
