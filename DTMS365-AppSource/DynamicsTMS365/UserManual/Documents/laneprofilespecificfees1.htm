<h1>Lane Profile Specific Fees</h1>
<p class="MsoNormal">Profile specific Fees are associated with a Lane and a 
Tariff.  The lane data determines what locations are affected by the Fee 
and the Tariff determines the cost configuration of the Fee.  When a tariff 
is selected the system searches for a match between both the Tariff and the Lane 
to determine if a fee should be assigned to the order.  A fee is only 
assigned if both the Lane and Tariff are configured to use the fee.  An 
example would be a Lift Gate Fee. If the location requires a Lift Gate the lane 
would be configured with the Lift Gate Profile Specific Fee. Then each carrier 
that provided Lift Gate Service would add the fee to the Tariff Fees 
configuration. When selecting the carrier manually a message is displayed on the 
carrier selection screen for carriers that do not have Lift Gate Service.  
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The system does not prevent carriers from being assigned or 
selected if they are not configured with a cost for a Profile specific Fee; the 
software assumes that the fee is zero. So, when setting up lowest cost carrier 
selection lanes it is important to understand how Profile specific Fees may or 
may not affect lowest cost carrier costing.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">An administrative tool called HDM Maintenance is available to 
assist with maintaining Lane Profile Specific Fees by zip code. This tool 
provides a way to mass update Fees at the Lane level when requirements change. 
An example would be Henry Hudson Bridge tolls in New York. A list of New York 
zip codes affected by the fee could be entered in the HDM Maintenance tool and 
the fee could be automatically added to each affected Lane. Each tariff could 
then be configured with a unique cost for the toll; some equipment may need to 
pay higher tolls than other. When this configuration is properly assigned to 
both Lanes and Tariffs the Profile specific Fee will be automatically included 
in the carrier’s estimated cost.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The process for over ridding Profile specific fees will 
follow the same rules as over ridding Tariff specific Fees. Also, Profile 
specific Fees will be grouped and displayed together with Tariff specific Fees 
on the Revenue tab, they will not be displayed with the Lane Fees.</p>
