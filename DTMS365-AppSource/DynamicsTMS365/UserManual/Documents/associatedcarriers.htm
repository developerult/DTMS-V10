<h3>Associated Carriers</h3>
<p class="MsoNormal">In some cases, TMS Admin’s may want to configure a TMS user’s 
credentials to give access to the Settlement Page like a carrier has access, to 
enter in freight invoices and fees. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Expand the black arrow next to the user and click on 
Associated Carriers.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Click Add to apply each carrier to this user’s profile and 
check the Accounting box.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Here you see this user has been granted access to carrier NGL 
Trans. This will allow this user to go to the Settlement Page and insert 
invoices and fees like a carrier would.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Note, this user will need to be granted access to the 
Settlement Page as part of the role set up.</p>
