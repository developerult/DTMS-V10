<h3>Missing Fee Approval Set Up</h3>
<p class="MsoNormal">When a fee comes into TMS for the first time via EDI or if it 
has not been configured as part of the carrier’s fee tolerance settings, users 
can configure the fee for automation so the next time this fee comes in, it will 
follow the business rules for automation and approval. Carriers who are entering 
invoices into the portal, should contact logistics if you do not see the fee 
you’re trying to enter. Users should update the carrier configuration for fee to 
display for carrier. (See <i>Carrier Page</i>-Accessorials)</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Click on <i>Add Config</i>.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><img src="../ImagesExt/image60_8.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The approval configuration screen will appear for users to 
configure accordingly.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><u>Auto Approve</u> = Check the box to have this fee auto 
approve based on tolerance settings. Otherwise, users will need to approve this 
fee next time if it was not included during dispatch/tender.<br /><u>Allow Carrier 
Updates</u> = Check the box to allow carrier edit/updates (via Portal or EDI) 
<b><i>Recommended</i></b>.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><u>Show Contracted Fees</u> = Check the box to display fees 
during invoice entry (via Portal). <b><i>Recommended.</i></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><img src="../ImagesExt/image60_9.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Then select your tolerance settings-</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Select only one.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="COLOR: #4472c4">BLUE UNDERLINE</span> -Insert 
dollar value low and high. For example, $0 (low) between $100 (high). You accept 
anything between $0 - $100 for this fee. Anything else fails audit tolerance, 
requires approval.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="COLOR: red">RED</span> <span style="COLOR: red">CIRCLE</span>– <i>Check Dynamic Expected Cost</i> to insert a 
percentage low and high range. For example, 100% (% below) to 25% (% above). 
Will approve $0 to 25% higher than the cost. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Or</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Set your expected cost at $50. Your percentage low set to 20% 
(which is $50-$10=$40) to 20% above ($50 + $10 = $60) above. This fee expected 
price range is between $40 - $60. Or just insert expected cost and no low/high 
range. </p><span id="related-topics"></span></body></html>
