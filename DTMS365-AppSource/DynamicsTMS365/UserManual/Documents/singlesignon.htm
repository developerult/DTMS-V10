<p class="MsoNormal">The new security model follows OAuth 2 specifications and 
does not store the user’s password on the client machine.  The 
authentication is managed by a user token which is updated periodically as the 
user signs in and out and navigates through the system.  When a desktop 
client is used to access D365 the system uses Windows Authentication to look up 
the users Token.  This Token is used to validate the user’s access to the 
system.   When the D365 NEXTrack Portal is accessed directly from the 
web browser it may be necessary for the user to log on with a username and 
password.  For this reason, NGL recommends the use of SSL encryption to 
secure the users initial sign on.  Passwords are encrypted and stored in 
the database.  Special logic developed by NGL is required to validate user 
passwords.  It is not possible for anyone to retrieve the unencrypted 
password.</p><span id="related-topics"></span></body></html>
