<h2>Tendered Page<br /><br /></h2>
<p class="MsoNormal">This page will display all load tenders sent to each carrier 
by the logistics department. Carriers will only be able to see their own load 
tender information. Upon tendering by the logistics group, an email will be sent 
to the carrier indicating a load has been tendered to them and they should login 
and ACCEPT/REJECT the load. It is important to inform carriers that there is an 
expiration time for them to accept loads. A PDF tender sheet will be attached to 
the email. API carriers will not receive a tender email. Only carriers will have 
access to the Tendered page.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><img src="../ImagesExt/image64_34.jpg" alt="" /><b><br /></b><br /><b>Accept Load</b> – Load will 
successfully save and be removed from screen. Will now be available in the ALL 
Page for further updates. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Reject Load</b>- If carrier rejects load, they’re required 
to enter reason-click save. This helps track carrier performance and 
reporting.</p>
