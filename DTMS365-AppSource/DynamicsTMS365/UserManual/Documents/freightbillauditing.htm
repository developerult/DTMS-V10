<h1>Freight Bill Auditing</h1>
<p class="MsoNormal">Freight bill auditing is a two-step process. First, approving 
fees that need approval and then running the audit process in the AP Freight 
Bill Audit Approval page. However, following your fee approval, the system will 
automatically trigger the audit process, if invoices pass audit it will 
automatically clear, thus saving users time. If the audit fails, these 
transactions will show up in M status and need to be fixed.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Fee Approval page (Under Load Planning) allows users to 
review fees entered into the portal by carriers or via EDI and require approval 
for auditing purposes. Fee tolerances can be assigned to each fee and approval 
automation can be configured. See <i>Carrier Page</i> for Fee Tolerances set 
up.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Assuming freight bills have been entered by carriers via the 
portal or EDI, here are the steps to process and audit freight bills.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Freight bills will come in on a daily or random basis from 
carriers. It is important to create a standard process as to how often you will 
tend to transactions that need approval and managing the exceptions. Freight 
bills will not be sent to the ERP system unless they have successfully passed 
the audit routine in TMS (AA status). All transactions must end up in AA status 
(Approved) in order to be sent to the ERP accounting system.</p>
