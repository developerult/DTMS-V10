<p class="MsoNormal">The NEXTrack Portal (AKA D365) has been upgraded with a new 
overall design; it is written so that the application is "responsive" to 
desktop, tablet and smartphone usage.  Most of the Legacy Desktop 
functionality has been incorporated into the new design; this minimizes the 
dependency on a Desktop Client.  User security assigned to the Desktop 
Client also applies to the NEXTrack Portal pages. When launching D365 from the 
desktop client the system uses single sign on to authenticate the user.</p><span id="related-topics"></span></body></html>
