<h2>Adding a Carrier Portal User</h2>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="tab-stops: 348.45pt"><br />Adding carrier users will 
allow access to <i>Web tenders</i>, <i>Load postings</i>, <i>Online scheduling, 
Freight bill entry.</i> We have two type of roles for carrier users. If your 
configuration will not use any of the above features, you do not need to set up 
carrier users. <b><u>Only Administrators can add users to TMS</u></b>.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="tab-stops: 348.45pt">1) <i>Carriers</i> - This user 
profile is typically for a dispatcher (accepts loads, schedules appts, and 
provides load status.<br />2) <i>Carrier Accountants</i> – This user profile 
enters in freight bills into the website but also can be a dispatcher (accept 
tenders) and other responsibilities like above. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="tab-stops: 348.45pt"><b>NOTE</b>: If you have 
dispatchers who also are responsible for entering in freight bill data, you can 
just set them up as a Carrier Accountants. Both carrier set ups will have access 
to the tender page.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="tab-stops: 348.45pt">In the Systems page, click on 
User Maintenance. Be sure to select the correct legal entity you want to work in 
if you have multiple legal entities.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="tab-stops: 348.45pt">In the Actions section, click on 
<i>Add New Carrier User</i></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="tab-stops: 348.45pt">Enter in carrier’s email address. 
This email address is the address that the TMS system will use to communicate 
with this user. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="tab-stops: 348.45pt"><img src="../ImagesExt/image39_17.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="tab-stops: 348.45pt">A recommended username is the 
carrier contact email address. It’s also recommended that you manually create a 
password and share it with the carrier directly. Before doing so, users should 
login as the carrier to confirm setup is correct. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="tab-stops: 348.45pt">Check the box for accounting 
<u>ONLY</u> if this user will be entering in freight invoices. This will give 
the user access to the Settlement and Settled pages. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="tab-stops: 348.45pt">Use the drop-down list to select 
the carrier this user is associated with.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="tab-stops: 348.45pt">Click Save in the upper 
right-hand corner.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="tab-stops: 348.45pt">An email will be sent to this 
carrier contact to include their password. Carriers can change their password 
once they login and by going to settings.</p><span id="related-topics"></span></body></html>
