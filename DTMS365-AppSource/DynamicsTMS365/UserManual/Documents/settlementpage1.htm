<h2>Settlement Page<br /><br /></h2>
<p class="MsoNormal">The settlement page is where carriers will enter in their 
freight invoices and fees. Again, depending on credentials, not all carrier 
users or TMS users will have access to this page. Carrier users, who have been 
set up as accounting users, will have access to the Settlement and Settled Page 
for carriers to enter invoices.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Settlement page allows carriers or TMS users to enter in 
freight invoices. We have two options and users should seek instructions on 
which option is best to use based on your implementation.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">1) <b>Quick Edit</b> – This is used for quick entry of the 
<i>Freight Invoice Number</i> and <i>Total Invoice Amount Only</i>. Click Save 
when done.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><img src="../ImagesExt/image64_20.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">2) <b>Detailed Freight Bill Entry</b>-This is used to allow 
carriers/users to insert additional fees as part of their invoice and apply 
tolerances at the fee level.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><img src="../ImagesExt/image64_21.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In order for carriers to see data and enter their freight 
invoice within the Settlement Page, they will be required to enter in a 
<b><i>delivery date/time stamp</i></b> in the ALL Page. <b><span style="COLOR: red">Only loads with a delivery date will appear in the Settlement 
Page.</span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><i>Carriers must enter in their invoice for each load (CNS 
/ ShipID). Summary invoices are not allowed. In situations where carriers have a 
summary invoice for more than 1 load, they must append a -1, -2 or –A, -B at the 
end of their invoice entry to make this freight invoice unique.</i></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><img src="../ImagesExt/image64_22.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">After the <i>Delivered-Checked In Date/Time</i> field has 
been populated, Click on Settlement to enter in your freight invoices.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><img src="../ImagesExt/image64_23.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">You can search for the CNS (aka ShipID) load you want to 
enter in your freight invoice for. Click on EDIT to insert your invoice.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><img src="../ImagesExt/image64_24.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Detailed Freight Bill Entry Screen will open. Yellow 
highlighted are required fields to be entered by carriers.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><img src="../ImagesExt/image64_25.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Carriers must enter in their Invoice Number. The Line Haul 
and fuel will autofill. The Fuel can be edited but not the Line Haul.  </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Once the invoice number has been entered, carriers can now 
enter in any fees associated with an invoice. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Click and expand the black arrow next to the CNS Number 
(ShipID) and click ADD FEE.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><img src="../ImagesExt/image64_26.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In most configurations, the fees will automatically display 
and be populated with the costing. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Select your appropriate fee that has been pre-configured and 
fee amount. Click <i>Add Fee</i> again to add additional fees.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><img src="../ImagesExt/image64_27.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Click SAVE icon when done entering in fees. It is important 
to note that once fees have been entered and saved, the invoice process is 
complete, and carriers cannot change anything.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><img src="../ImagesExt/image64_28.png" alt="" /></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">After entering in your invoice, fee, and clicking save. The 
system will update the status of the invoice based on the TMS configuration.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">There are three statuses:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i>Approved</i> = the system automatically approved the 
entry, passed audit, and will disappear from the screen. Setting the PExp (Pay 
Expense workflow to AA-auto approved) in the Load Detail Screen.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i>Pending Approval</i> = the system accepted carrier entry 
and is waiting on TMS user approval. This transaction will remain in the Pending 
Approval Page until a user approves them.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><img src="../ImagesExt/image64_29.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The status will be updated in TMS on all loads that are 
<i>Pending Approval</i> (PA). Setting the PExp (Pay Expense workflow to 
PA-Pending Approval) in the Load Detail Screen.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><img src="../ImagesExt/image64_30.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i>Failed </i>= the system accepted the freight invoice entry 
as a matched transaction in TMS but has failed the audit process. Users should 
communicate with carriers and run Audit Report and to resolve the invoice. All 
transactions will need to be fixed, pass audit, and will automatically set to AA 
status.</p>
